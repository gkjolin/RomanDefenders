# Roman Defenders
A strategy game with tactical buildings and cute soldiers that was created as my diploma thesis. Settlers 4 feeling included!

## Getting Started

This game was made by Jonathan Friedrich (me, programming) and Annika Kirmes (3D artist) in a three month period of time

## About us

I first got in touch with Code back in 2010, when opening the [HexagonMC Minecraft Server](https://hexagonmc.eu) that is still live. Working as sys admin there + helping out as supporter with many open source mc projects. Studying game programming since 2017 till now. Confident in Java and C#. I love keeping code and systems well organized, tidy and up to date

Annika Kirmes is studying 3D Game artist focusing on everything that "lives", like plants, trees and entities.

### Whats the game about and how to win

I love the settlers 4 + 5 and when started learning programming last year, my biggest wish was to create a small playable 
demo to gap the time until the next settlers arrives. At this time it wasn't announced, but it now is!
You can play swordsman, bowman, horseman, catapults and a hero that can cast awesome skills.
By building mines, you gather mana, the main resource for everything. Build farms to increase your entity limit and don't forget
to improve your armys defense and offense by leveling the techtree in your forge.
The demo level includes a wave based enemy system. If you survived all waves, build a strong army to destroy the enemys base!

### Building

- Git clone or download the ZIP and extract
- import the folder into Unity
- Build the game
- Have fun!

### ToDo

- Sound assets are in the process of making by an audio student as his Bachelor thesis
